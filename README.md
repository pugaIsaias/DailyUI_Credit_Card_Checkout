# DailyUI_Credit_Card_Checkout

Doing Daily UI 100 days / Day 2

## Notes

Found out that people just use Figma to design and don't do front-end.... Weird.

Maybe taking a detour to learn Figma and for planning does something good for me. 1.5hr later..

- Learned that from Figma I can get a good chunk of the CSS
- It can be easy way to export in PNG designs for the clients
- Also can do prototypes using phone layouts, transitions, and animations to show app functionality. 

## Instructions

Design Hint...  Design a credit card checkout form or page. Don't forget the important elements such as the numbers, dates, security numbers, etc.  

Share your design on Dribbble or Twitter with #DailyUI
