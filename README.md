# DailyUI_Credit_Card_Checkout

Doing Daily UI 100 days / Day 2
Found out that people just use Figma to design and don't do front-end. Weird.

Maybe taking a detour to learn Figma and for planning does something good for me. 

Design Hint...  Design a credit card checkout form or page. Don't forget the important elements such as the numbers, dates, security numbers, etc.  
Share your design on Dribbble or Twitter with #DailyUI
